## Quick Installation of RasQberry

Quick setup instructions:<br/>
Initialize an SD card with Raspberry Pi Imager, using the recommended "bookworm, 64-bit". (development was conducted with the default "pi" user, but other users should be possible as well)

Open the terminal/ssh window on your Raspberry Pi.

Download and execute the bootstrap script RasQ-init.sh, which will add the RasQberry sub-menu to raspi-config.

```
wget https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two/raw/main/RasQ-init.sh -O RasQ-init.sh
. ./RasQ-init.sh
```

This will modify the raspi-config Configuration Tool and add a RasQberry menu at the top. You can now start raspi-config as usual:

```
sudo raspi-config
```

Then select "0 RasQberry" to enter the RasQberry sub-menu.
"SU System Update" is optional, but recommended.
Run "IC Initial Config" for an initial configuration and to create the main python venv for RasQberry.
Now run " IQ Qiskit Install" and install your preferred Qiskit version (1.0 or 1.1). The installation will take about 2 min on a Raspberry Pi 4.

### File structure:

- **RasQ-init.sh**: bootstrap-script, which will add the RasQberry sub-menu to raspi-config
- **RQB2_menu.sh**: menu and sub-menu that integrate into raspi-config
- **env-config.sh**: script to set environment variables, as defined in env
- **env**: environment variables, being imported by env-config.sh
- **rq_install_Qiskit\** *: install procedure for different Qiskit versions

### working with Qiskit

To work with Qiskit, enter the default python venv

```
. $HOME/$REPO/venv/$STD_VENV/bin/activate
```

which in the most cases is

```
. /home/pi/RasQberry-Two/venv/RQB2/bin/activate
```

Then, qiskit should be usable:

```
(RQB2) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ pip list | grep qiskit
qiskit                 1.1.1
qiskit-qasm3-import    0.5.0
```

Please let us know in case additional modules are needed.
